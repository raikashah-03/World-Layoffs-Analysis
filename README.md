# World-Layoffs-Analysis
I have used the "layoffs" dataset that contains detailed information about layoffs from various companies worldwide, including dates, locations, and numbers of affected employees.

First, I cleaned the raw data using MySQL queries to ensure accuracy and consistency. This step involved filtering out incomplete entries, standardizing formats, removing duplicates and organizing the data into a usable structure.

Once the data was clean, I explored the trends to uncover insightful patterns. Through my analysis, you can see how layoffs have varied over time, which industries were most impacted, and how different regions compare. This project aims to provide a clear and comprehensive view of global layoff trends in an accessible and understandable way.
